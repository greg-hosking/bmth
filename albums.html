            <h5 class>
              Post Human: Survival Horror is a commercial release by British rock band
              Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on October 30, 2020. It was preceded
              by three singles: "Parasite Eve", "Obey", and "Teardrops". "Ludens", which
              was previously released as a single for the soundtrack Death Stranding:
              Timefall in November 2019, was also included in the track listing. The
              release was produced by frontman Oliver Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish,
              with additional production from composer Mick Gordon. It is the first in a
              series of four projects to be released by the band under the Post Human name.
              The release received generally positive reviews from critics, with some
              considering it a return to the heavier sound of the band's early material.

              by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on December 27, 2019

              Music to Listen To… is the longest musical project by Bring Me the Horizon,

              2019 album Amo and demos they had previously recorded.

              Malia playing lead and rhythm. Written and recorded throughout 2012,
              Sempiternal showed the band pull diverse influences from electronic music,

              Chart. It also managed to reach No. 11 on the US Billboard 200 with 27,522
              first week sales, making Sempiternal the band's highest charting album in
              America until That's the Spirit debuted at No. 2 in 2015. Upon its release,

              a Secret. (sometimes abbreviated to There Is a Hell...) is the third studio
              album by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on
              October 4, 2010. The album was primarily produced by Fredrik Nordström and
              Henrick Udd at IF Studios in Gothenburg, Sweden. It features guest vocals
              from Canadian singer Lights, British singer Josh Franceschi, and American
              vocalist Josh Scogin. The album expands on the band's previous material,
              drawing from the metalcore genre and incorporating a wide variety of
              experimentation. The band described Oliver Sykes' lyric writing as
              "personal" and "darker and moodier than music on the previous albums".
              There Is a Hell... received mostly favourable reviews from music critics,
              who praised the album's musicianship, lyrical content, experimentation,
              and maturity compared with the band's previous material.

              Suicide Season is the second studio album by British rock band Bring Me
              the Horizon. It was released on November 18, 2008. The album shows a major
              change musically from their previous releases, abandoning their original
              deathcore sound. Critically, the album received a mixed response. Though
              praised from the musical shift from the style of 2006's Count Your Blessings,
              the album was criticised for its song writing and musical aesthetics. The
              album has received more favourable retrospective analysis, notably surrounding
              Bring Me the Horizon's later critical acclaim.

              Count Your Blessings is the debut studio album by British rock band Bring
              Me the Horizon. It was released on August 14, 2007. Count Your Blessings
              is representative of the band's early deathcore sound, which was phased
              out on later releases and eventually abandoned in favour of other, less
              aggressive styles. The band members were young when they recorded the album,
              and both the band and its fans have largely disregarded it later in their
              career as inferior to their later material; it began as early as 2008,
              when guitarist Lee Malia was already criticising the album's quality. Most
              of the songs on the record quickly faded from the band's live setlists.
              Most band members recorded their parts individually. The album received some
              negative reviews, with the main complaints revolving around musical originality,
              although it still reached number 93 on the UK Albums Chart.

              This Is What The Edge Of Your Seat Was Made For is the first EP by Bring
              Me the Horizon. It was released on September 25, 2004. The EP received
              heavy criticism. Jack Rogers writing for Rock Sound reviewed the song
              "RE: They Have No Reflections" and commented that it is "Scrappy, heavy
              and completely and utterly debauched".

              That's the Spirit is the fifth studio album by British rock band Bring Me the
              Horizon. The album was released on September 11, 2015, and marks a departure
              from the group's metalcore roots, in favour of a less aggressive alternative
              rock and metal style. The album debuted at number one in Australia and Canada,
              number two in the UK Albums Chart, and the US Billboard 200. The album received
              universal acclaim from music critics.

              There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It
              a Secret. (sometimes abbreviated to There Is a Hell...) is the third studio
              album by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on
              October 4, 2010. The album was primarily produced by Fredrik Nordström and
              Henrick Udd at IF Studios in Gothenburg, Sweden. It features guest vocals
              from Canadian singer Lights, British singer Josh Franceschi, and American
              vocalist Josh Scogin. The album expands on the band's previous material,
              drawing from the metalcore genre and incorporating a wide variety of
              experimentation. The band described Oliver Sykes' lyric writing as
              "personal" and "darker and moodier than music on the previous albums".
              There Is a Hell... received mostly favourable reviews from music critics,
              who praised the album's musicianship, lyrical content, experimentation,
              and maturity compared with the band's previous material.

              Count Your Blessings is the debut studio album by British rock band Bring
              Me the Horizon. It was released on August 14, 2007. Count Your Blessings
              is representative of the band's early deathcore sound, which was phased
              out on later releases and eventually abandoned in favour of other, less
              aggressive styles. The band members were young when they recorded the album,
              and both the band and its fans have largely disregarded it later in their
              career as inferior to their later material; it began as early as 2008,
              when guitarist Lee Malia was already criticising the album's quality. Most
              of the songs on the record quickly faded from the band's live setlists.
              Most band members recorded their parts individually. The album received some
              negative reviews, with the main complaints revolving around musical originality,
              although it still reached number 93 on the UK Albums Chart.
